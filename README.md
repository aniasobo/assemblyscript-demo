# Sample AssemblyScript project

AssemblyScript is a TypeScript-to-WebAssembly compiler that allows for an easy integration of JavaScript with WebAssembly.

To create your AssemblyScript project, run this in project directory after your `npm init`: `npm install --save-dev github:AssemblyScript/assemblyscript`

To generate project scaffold run `npx asinit .`

**For development:**

* Run with `npm run asbuild`
* Run in watch mode with `npm run asbuild:watch`
* Run `node benchmark` to compare performance between `AssemblyScript` and `JavaScript`

**Demo**

* Run `npm run serve-demo`
* open the `localhost` url in your browser
